# Algotrading

This package aims at making algo trading easy. For this reason, it exposes a platform kind of thing to ease `backtesting` and `trading` a strategy

## Backtesting
We simply use an open source library called `backtrader`. On top it, we expose a convenient wrapper that can easily backtest different symbols against different strategies
